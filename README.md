## Ordered Binary Tree
My initial thought was to separate my tree struct from the .c file to maintain readability, however, I only needed one simple struct so I kept it within the .c file. Next, I implemented a quick and simple insert function that reflected the prototype given. I was struggling to come up with a way to keep track of the same tree without returning it due to the insert being a void type, so I reached out to a professor who recommended I change the insert method to use a double pointer for the struct tree_t instead. Finally, I decided to traverse the tree in order and simply print the values. I understand that I was given a specific prototype to follow, however, I was unsure of how to continue without making the recommended change.
